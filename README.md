# Pegasus-Switch

> Pegasus switch implementation. 

---

This repository is part of the [**Pegasus**](https://github.com/NDN-PEGASUS) project, a cross-platform forwarding acceleration architecture for Named Data Networking (NDN).

⚠️ Note: Pegasus is currently under a peer-review process. Therefore, we are currently releasing only the P4 implementation of the Pegasus switch data plane for review purposes. Once Pegasus is accepted for publication, we will release all core code.
